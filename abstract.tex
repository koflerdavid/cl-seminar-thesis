Equivalence of finite automata is an important problem in automata theory.
Previous algorithms, chiefly Hopcroft and Karp's algorithm, are adequate
  for checking equivalence only for deterministic finite automata, where they
  have runtime almost linear in the number of states.
Bonchi and Pous developed improvements to this algorithm to make them suitable
  for nondeterministic finite automata, proved their correctness, and evaluated them experimentally.
This thesis summarises their results.
