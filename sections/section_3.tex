\section{Finite automata}

This section serves to review the theory of finite automata, to define the
problem of checking equivalence, and to highlight its challenges.

\subsection{Nondeterministic finite automata}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{Nondeterministic Finite Automaton} (NFA) $N = \langle Q_N, \Sigma_N, S_N, F_N, \delta_N \rangle$ consists of five parts:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item a finite set of states $Q_N$,
    \item a finite set of symbols $\Sigma_N$, called the input alphabet,
    \item a set of starting states $S_N \subseteq Q_N$,
    \item a set of accepting states $F_N \subseteq Q_N$, and
    \item a transition function $\delta_N : (Q_N \times \Sigma_N) \to \mathcal{P}(Q_N)$ mapping a state and an input symbol
            to a set of successor states.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The purpose of an automaton is to accept or to reject a word
composed of symbols from the input alphabet.
A finite automaton does this by starting out from one of the
states and then using every symbol of the input word (in the given
order) and the mapping $\delta_N$ to reach a successor state.
In general there can be more than one (or no) ways to proceed since $\delta_N$ returns a set of possible successor states.
Formally, this is what the function $\hat{\delta}_N$ does:

\begin{definition}
  \begin{align*}
    \hat{\delta}_N(p, \epsilon) &= \{p\}\\
    \hat{\delta}_N(p, aw) &= \bigcup_{q \in \delta_N(p, a)}\hat{\delta}_N(q, w)
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

A finite automata accepts an input word if it is possible to reach one of the
accepting states by using all of the word's characters.
The set of words which an automaton accepts is called its language:

\begin{definition}
  $\mathcal{L}(N) = \{ w \forWhich \exists s \in S_N: \hat{\delta}_N(s, w) \cap F_N \neq \emptyset \}$
\end{definition}

For the purpose of this thesis it is interesting to start from an arbitrary set of states of the automaton.

\begin{definition}
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{L}_N(P) &= \{ w \forWhich \exists p \in P: \hat{\delta}_N(p, w) \cap F_N \neq \emptyset\}\\
    \mathcal{L}(N) &= \mathcal{L}_N(S_N)
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

A Deterministic Finite Automaton $D$ is special in that $\delta_M$ assigns to
every state and input symbol exactly one successor state.
Also, there is exactly one initial state.

It is important to notice that the cardinality of the set of states of a
determinised NFA is $\mathcal{O}(2^{|Q|})$.
This can quickly become a big problem if algorithms and representations of
automata are not chosen properly, as the following subsection will show.


\subsection{Deterministic Finite Automata}

Every NFA $N$ can be converted into the DFA
$N^\# = \langle \mathcal{P}(Q_N), \Sigma_N, \{ S_N \}, F_{N^\#}, \delta_{N^\#} \rangle$:
`'
\begin{definition}
  \begin{align*}
    F_{N^\#} &= \{ P \in \mathcal{P}(Q) \forWhich P \cap F \neq \emptyset \}\\
    \delta_{N^\#}(P, a) &= \bigcup_{p \in P} \delta_N(p, a)
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Minimization and equivalence of finite automata}

Within the above framework it is easy to define automata which have inaccessible
states, that is, there is no input word which can reach one of those states.
Also, it is possible to introduce redundancies into an automata.

\begin{example}
  These two automata accept exactly the same language:\\
  \center
  \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=3cm,on grid,auto]
    \node[state,initial,accepting] (p) [] {$p$};
    \node[state,initial,accepting] (q_0) [right=of p] {$q_0$};
    \node[state,accepting] (q_1) [right=of q_0] {$q_1$};
    \path[->]
      (p) edge [loop above] node {a} ()
      (q_0) edge [bend left] node {a} (q_1)
      (q_1) edge [bend left] node {a} (q_0);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{example}

Since many useful applications of automata use PSPACE-complete algorithms it
is desireable to minimize the number of states of an automaton.
For DFAs this is a well-researched topic, and there are efficient algorithms.
It is not so easy for NFAs however: the simplest approach would be to
determinise the automaton and then use a minimization algorithm.
This is PSPACE-complete though because of the determinisation.

We get similar results for determining equivalence of NFAs and DFAs:
Hopcroft and Karp developed an (almost) linear algorithm for the deterministic
case which runs in $\mathcal{O}(n \times \alpha(n))$ thanks to a
Union-Find data structure\footnote{$\alpha$ is the inverse of Ackermann's
function, which grows extremely slowly.}.
However, for the NFA case we are stuck with PSPACE-completeness, for the same
reason as in the minimization case.

In both cases research focuses on looking for algorithms whose
(runtime or memory) complexity is exponential only in the worst case.
