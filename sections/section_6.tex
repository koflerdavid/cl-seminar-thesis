\section{Conclusion}

Bonchi and Pous algorithms on first glance deliver impressive improvements over
  existing algorithms.
The main open research directions yielded by these results are firstly
  repeating the experiments with an implementation in the same programming
  language.
Secondly, the performance impact of computing the similarity closure when testing
  for equivalence has to be determined.
Thirdly, the impact of other approaches to store relations of sets of states
  could be researched.
Lastly, it has to be researched whether the approach can be extended to
other automata constructions, for example tree automata.
